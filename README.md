# PopularMoviesStage2
Android Developer Nanodegree project that allows users to discover the most popular/Top Rated movies playing and build Favorites collection

## API Notes
Since this application uses a RESTful API to retrieve movie data, an API key is required to query The Movie DB. For privacy and Terms of Service reasons, the API key has been removed from this public repo. To run and review the application, you can register for an API key by signing up for an account at https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup
